# The Library Project
## Info
This Python script helps users decide which (Smith College) library to go to based on their preferences, location, and the time of day.

## Usage
This script is designed for general use! The code can be run in a Python environment, I used Python 3.11.5 in the most recent version.

## Dependencies
This script depends on the `random` library, which is part of the Python standard library.
